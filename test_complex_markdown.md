# Feature 2 Proposal: Aider Orchestration & Skills Framework (v1.1)

## Overview
**Title:** Autonomous TDD Workflow with Aider Integration
**Objective:** Enable Orion to coordinate TaraAider (testing) and DevonAider (implementation) through a structured skills framework and helper services.

## Core Problem Statement
Orion can decompose features and manage tasks, but cannot delegate single-file implementation/testing work to specialized Aider agents.

## Key Constraints
1. **Aiders cannot read files** - Context must be provided in prompts
2. **Aiders cannot run tests** - Separate test runner needed
3. **Concurrent file edits risk** - Need file locking or serialization
4. **Aider response format unspecified** - Need standardized schema
5. **No error handling/rollback** - Need robust failure recovery

## Tasks
### Task 2-1: Database Extensions for Step Management
**Description:** Create database tables to track single-file steps.

### Task 2-2: Core Helper Services
**Description:** Build the essential helper services for step decomposition and context building.

## Success Metrics
1. **Step Completion Rate:** >80% without manual intervention
2. **Test Pass Rate:** Maintain or improve existing test pass rates
3. **Error Recovery:** >90% of errors handled automatically
4. **Development Velocity:** 2x faster subtask completion
