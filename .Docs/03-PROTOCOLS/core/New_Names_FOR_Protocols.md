1. Naming — Something Engineers Will Actually Respect

You want names that:

Don’t sound fluffy

Signal rigor

Feel familiar, not “AI woo”

Core System Name (what you’re building)

Constraint-Aware Planning (CAP)

“This system does not execute plans that violate physical or tool constraints.”

This is strong, simple, and accurate.

CDP (what you already have)

Rename Constraint Discovery Protocol (CDP) to one of these (pick based on vibe):

Option A (Most practical):

Preflight Constraint Check (PCC)
Engineers immediately get this. Aviation metaphor works.


Fractal Analysis Protocol

This one matters. “Fractal” is cool but abstract.

Best engineering-aligned names:

⭐ Recommended

Recursive Execution Decomposition (RED)

Why this works:

Sounds like compilers

Sounds like systems engineering

No fluff

Other viable options

Constraint Closure Analysis (CCA)

Atomic Dependency Expansion (ADE)

Execution Readiness Analysis (ERA)

If I were writing docs:

“Every feature must pass RED + PCC before implementation.”

That sounds very legit.
