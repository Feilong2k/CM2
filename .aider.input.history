+I mean /read command for Aider, what does that do?

# 2026-01-01 14:21:36.504405
+no, I need to understand if you can read the files provided to us by the /read command?

# 2026-01-01 14:23:25.712553
+I understand now, if I was assigning a task to Aider through cli, and I ran the /read command on a few files, that Aider AI would use those files as part of its context and then work on the file that's added to it by the /add command, is this a correct statement?

# 2026-01-01 14:26:09.496205
+If I have some instruction in a file that Aider needs to edit, ran the /add command on that file, will Aider be able to use the instruction in the file and create the edit?

# 2026-01-01 14:28:39.000359
+so I can't call Aider with something like Aider /read x_test.js /add x.js "promptimplement the TODO comment?
